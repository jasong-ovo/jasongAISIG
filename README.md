# GPU SUPERVISING IN NORMAL ENVIRONMENT
This repository is built for *usage data of gpu* running ML task in normal environment.
I choose *cifar-10* as the dataset.
Experiment is planned to be carried on *VGG* networks and *RESNET* networks.
I will record the figure for *sm* and *memory* being used, and the *accuracy* of each epoch.
